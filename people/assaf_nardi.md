Assaf Nardi is our M.Sc. student supervised together with Prof. Idit Avrahami. Assaf works on an exciting project of thrombosis in blood vessels 
and its hemodynamic aspects. We have been studying some aspects before but maybe this is the first time where we could visualize the 
stresses more or less directly, thanks to the collaboration with the group of Prof. Korin from the Technion.
